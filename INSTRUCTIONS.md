INSTRUCTIONS 
––––––––––––

1. Loaded the dataset from `torchvision.datasets`
2. Used transforms or other PyTorch methods to convert the data to tensors, normalize, and flatten the data
3. Created a DataLoader for my dataset
4. Visualized the dataset using the provided function
5. Used either my training data and inverting any normalization and flattening OR a second DataLoader without any normalization or flattening
6. Provided a brief justification of any necessary preprocessing steps or why no preprocessing is needed.
7. Used PyTorch to build a neural network to predict the class of each given input image
8. Created an optimizer to update my network's weights
9. Used the training DataLoader to train my neural network
10. Tuned my model hyperparameters and network architecture with at least 90% accuracy on the test set.
11. Used `torch.save` to save my trained model.
